	 Here you can change default flags passed to gcc when components of your
	 embedded system target are built: C library, packages, ...
	 By default we optimize for size.

config EMBTK_TARGET_STRIPPED
	bool "Strip target's binaries"
	help
	 Say yes if you want to strip binaries (including libraries) generated
	 for your target embedded system. This will reduce the size of these
	 binaries.
	 Note: These binaries are only stripped if you choose to build a root
	 filesystem.

	 If you want to build a root filesystem for your target, and include
	 some packages within it, you must say yes here.

	help
	 Directory where downloaded packages are stored.

	 You must specify here an absolute directory location, if you choose to
	 use an alternate location.

	 Note:
	 If you want to preserve downloaded packages from being removed when
	 you do make distclean, you must specify an alternate location.
	 If you leave this option in the default location under Embtoolkit,
	 $(EMBTK_ROOT)/dl, then make distclean will remove downloaded packages.
	 But keep in mind that only a make distclean command will remove
	 downloaded packages in the default location under EmbToolkit,
	 not make clean.

config EMBTK_CACHE_PATCHES
	bool "Preserve first downloaded patches and do not download new one"
	default y
	help
	 When this option is enable, new patches for packages will not be
	 downloaded the second time you run the build process.
